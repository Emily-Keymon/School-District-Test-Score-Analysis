# School District Test Score Analysis
The goal of this project was to analyze the standardized test results for a school district.  Using the math and reading scores, aggregate the data and showcase obvious trends in school performance.

## Data source


### District Summary

* Create a high level snapshot (in table form) of the district's key metrics, including:
  * Total Schools
  * Total Students
  * Total Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
  * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
  * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)

### School Summary

* Create an overview table that summarizes key metrics about each school, including:
  * School Name
  * School Type
  * Total Students
  * Total School Budget
  * Per Student Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
  * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
  * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)

### Top Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)

* Create a table that highlights the top 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Include:
  * School Name
  * School Type
  * Total Students
  * Total School Budget
  * Per Student Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
  * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
  * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)

### Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)

* Create a table that highlights the bottom 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Include all of the same metrics as above.

### Math Scores by Grade\*\*

* Create a table that lists the average Math Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

### Reading Scores by Grade

* Create a table that lists the average Reading Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

### Scores by School Spending

* Create a table that breaks down school performances based on average Spending Ranges (Per Student). Use 4 reasonable bins to group school spending. Include in the table each of the following:
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
  * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
  * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)

### Scores by School Size

* Repeat the above breakdown, but this time group schools based on a reasonable approximation of school size (Small, Medium, Large).

### Scores by School Type

* Repeat the above breakdown, but this time group schools based on school type (Charter vs. District).
